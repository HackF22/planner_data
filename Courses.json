Topics include coverage of all the supported data types and program code structures, functions (up through lambda expressions and recursion), reasoning about and debugging existing code, implementation of custom libraries, selection of data structures, and the fundamentals of object-oriented programming. Students will create, debug, and run Python 3 programs that explore each of these topics in turn, from simple loops up through the processing of large data sets, and eventually to the creation of professional-quality libraries to synthesize graphics images and audio files. No prior programming experience expected. Not open to Computer Science majors. 3 credits."

It is designed around active lecture sessions supported by readings, working classes, and team projects, where students practice and explore the concepts introduced in lecture, and go well beyond them to learn and apply HCI techniques that build into group projects. More specifically, the course adopts a human-centered design (HCD) approach and teaches a highly iterative process called design thinking. The design thinking process draws heavily on the fundamentals of human-computer interaction (HCI) methods.

The typical smartphone comes equipped with a plethora of sensors for monitoring activity, speech patterns, social interactions, and location. In addition, mobile accessories such as wearable wristbands and chestbands now enable routine and continuous monitoring of a host of physiological signals (e.g., heart rate, respiratory rate, skin Conductance, and others.). In conjunction, these sensors can enable higher-order inferences about more complex human activities/behavioral states (e.g., activity patterns, stress, sleep, etc.). Such ubiquitous sensing in daily life, referred to as mobile health sensing and monitoring, promises to revolutionize our understanding of human activities and health conditions.  This course is an introduction to personal health sensing and monitoring through mobile phones and on-body sensors and addresses several aspects including mobile devices and applications for health, sensor data quality and reliability challenges, inference of key health assessments from sensor data including such as activity patterns, sleep patterns, or stress, sensor data visualization and feedback, and practical considerations such as battery lifetime.

    "description": "In this course we examine the important problems in operating system design and implementation.  The operating system provides a well-known, convenient, and efficient interface between user programs and the bare hardware of the computer on which they run.  The operating system is responsible for allowing resources (e.g., disks, networks, and processors) to be shared, providing common services needed by many different programs (e.g., file service, the ability to start or stop processes, and access to the printer), and protecting individual programs from one another.  The course will start with a brief historical perspective of the evolution of operating systems over the last fifty years, and then cover the major components of most operating systems.  This discussion will cover the tradeoffs that can be made between performance and functionality during the design and implementation of an operating system.  Particular emphasis will be given to three major OS subsystems: process management (processes, threads, CPU scheduling, synchronization, and deadlock), memory management (segmentation, paging, swapping), file systems, and operating system support for distributed systems.

It controls life-critical applications, such as air traffic control and medical devices, and is of central importance in telecommunication and electronic commerce.  In this course, we will examine state-of-the-art practices for software testing and analysis to verify software quality.  We will initially look at techniques for testing and analyzing sequential programs, and then examine the complexity that arises from distributed programs.  The students will be required to complete regular homework assignments and exams, and carry out a group research project extending techniques described in class and/or applying them to new domains.

Applications of reinforcement learning span across medicine (How much insulin should be injected next? What drug should be given next?), marketing (What ad should be shown next?), robotics (How much power should be given to the motor?), game playing (What move should be made next?), environmental applications (Which countermeasure for an invasive species should be deployed next?), and dialogue systems (What type of sentence should be spoken next?), among many others. Broad topics covered in this course will include: Markov decision processes, reinforcement learning algorithms (model-based/model-free, batch/online, value function-based, actor-critics, policy gradient methods, etc.), and representations for reinforcement learning. Special topics may include ensuring the safety of reinforcement learning algorithms, hierarchical reinforcement learning, theoretical reinforcement learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and connections to animal learning.

As a result, graphical models have become invaluable tools in a wide range of areas from computer vision and sensor networks to natural language processing and computational biology. The aim of this course is to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively design, implement and apply these models to solve real problems. The course will cover (a) Bayesian and Markov networks and their dynamic and relational extensions; (b) exact and approximate inference methods; (c) estimation of both the parameters and structure of graphical models.

This seminar examines recent work in explanatory and tutoring systems, presents theories about digital teaching and learning, and describes how to deliver personalized teaching in online systems. Such software supports people working alone or in collaborative inquiry to rapidly access and integrate global information.

No programming is required. Students will read and critique papers about AI tools (e.g., vision, natural language), methods, and will study the complexity of human learning through advances in cognitive science.

Students in this course will learn and use the Python programming language, creating scripts from the ground up to collect, manipulate, and analyze real and fascinating data sets.  We will learn to ask and answer questions from data, and will cover all phases of the analytics process,  from basic data wrangling and transformation to communicating through visualization. This course requires mathematical background in probability and statistics, and experience programming in some modern programming language. Does not count as a CS Elective (BA or BS).

The detailed components of the course are as follows. Following an overview of the clinical health informatics industry, the course covers a broad range of introductory topics, including the structure of current health care systems, types of health data, the theory and practical use of quantitative analytic methodologies, and ethics related to healthcare. More specifically, this course will introduce key health informatics technologies and standards, including electronic health records, medical claims data, imaging data, free-text clinical notes, patient-reported outcomes, traditional and machine learning-based analytic algorithms, data visualization, and clinical research and experimental procedures. Note, however, that the course is not designed to introduce new types of machine learning or artificial intelligence algorithms for health-related data. This course is taught in the same classroom with students from COMPSCI 590W. However, students enrolled in INFO 390W will be evaluated independently of students from COMPSCI 590W.

Specific topics include linked structures, recursive structures and algorithms, binary trees, balanced trees, and hash tables. These topics are fundamental to programming and are essential to other courses in computer science. The course involves weekly programming assignments, in-class quizzes, discussion section exercises, and multiple exams. Prerequisites: COMPSCI 121 (or equivalent Java experience).  A grade of B or better in COMPSCI 121 (or a grade of C or better in COMPSCI 186 (or COMPSCI 190D) is required for students enrolling in COMPSCI 187 and Basic Math Skills (R1).
